   <h1>Circular Dependencies</h1>
   <p>The require function given earlier in this chapter supports this type of dependency cycle.</p>
   <h2>Can you see how it handles cycles?</h2>
   <p>- Since "require" adds modules before it starts loading whatever call is made, the current interface would be returned.</p>
   <h2>What would go wrong when a module in a cycle does replace its default exports object?</h2>
   <p>- If a module in a cycle replace its default exports object, another module receiving its interface value would receive the default instead of the intented value.</p>
